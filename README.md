# Calculator
 This project is a basic calculator web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator interface consists of a display screen where the user input and calculated results are shown. The layout includes numeric buttons (0-9), arithmetic operation buttons (+, -, *, /), and additional functionalities such as clear (AC) and equal (=) buttons.  The HTML structure defines the layout of the calculator, including the display screen and buttons. CSS is used to style the calculator, providing visual enhancements such as button colors, font styles, and overall layout design.  JavaScript is utilized to implement the functionality of the calculator. Event listeners are added to the buttons to capture user input and perform calculations based on the user's actions. The script handles arithmetic operations, input validation, and updating the display screen with the appropriate results.  Overall, this simple calculator project demonstrates the fundamental concepts of web development, including HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript functionality, providing users with a basic tool for performing arithmetic calculations conveniently within their web browser.
